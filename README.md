Course Description
----------------------------------------
After successful completion of this course, it helped me to...

```
  * This course is an introduction to computer functions and introductory networking concepts.
  * Through activity-based learning and an Internet of Things (IoT) project, one can examine the
    relationships between computer, operating system, and networking components. 
  * One can examine the roles of computers and networking devices and demonstrate how to deploy
    this equipment to achieve computer functionality and network connectivity. 
  * One can gain hands-on knowledge and troubleshooting capabilities.
  * Upon successful completion of this subject one can able to do the following:
     > Identify and describe computer hardware components to troubleshoot technical problems with computer systems.
     > Compare and contrast computer hardware components to install and replace computer system components.
     > Evaluate computer hardware components to recommend an appropriate computer system configuration within a
       computing environment.
     > Recognize and explain networking terminology to support the maintenance of an existing network infrastructure.
     > Identify and apply the appropriate networking tools to diagnose and troubleshoot network connectivity.
     > Construct a working LAN model to support the implementation and configuration of a network infrastructure.
     > Investigate and construct an Internet of Things (IoT) cloud solution to solve real world problems.

I declare that all the code and work in this repository is entirely my own work.

NOTE: For others, this repo can be a good reference, if someone wants to learn &
understand the aspects of Computer Networking & Internet of Things and anyone 
must not copy the work completed by me or included in this repo!
